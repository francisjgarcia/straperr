# Project Governance

This file describes the structure and processes for managing this project. Currently, I am the sole maintainer, but I am open to suggestions and contributions from external collaborators.

## Governance Structure

- **Primary Maintainer**: [@francisjgarcia](https://github.com/francisjgarcia)

## Decision-Making Process

As the sole maintainer, all final decisions are made by me. However, I am open to suggestions and changes proposed by others.

## Contribution Process

1. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Collaborators should create a PR from their feature branch to the `development` branch. Be sure to provide a clear and detailed description of the change in the PR.
2. **Review**: I will review the PR on the `development` branch and provide feedback or suggestions if needed. If the PR meets the project’s criteria and improves its quality or functionality, I will approve it.
3. **Merge into `development`**: Once reviewed and approved, the PR will be merged into the `development` branch. This allows the changes to be tested in the development environment.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Changes will be tested in the `development` branch before being merged into `main`.
5. **Merge into `main`**: After testing and validation in `development`, changes will be merged into the `main` branch, which contains the stable code of the project.

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of disagreements about a proposal or change, the issue will be discussed directly through the repository’s issue tracker. If consensus cannot be reached, the final decision will be made by me.

## Communication

- **Project Updates**: Updates and changes to the project will be documented in repository commits. After changes are merged into `main`, they will be added to the changelog.
- **Questions and Comments**: For questions or comments, use the repository’s issue tracker. I will be available to review and respond to concerns.

This document may be updated as necessary as the project evolves or circumstances change.
